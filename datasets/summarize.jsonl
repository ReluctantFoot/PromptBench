{"id": "artemis001", "input": "NASA has officially announced a launch window for Artemis III, the mission that will return humans to the Moon for the first time in over 50 years. The mission is scheduled to launch no earlier than September 2026. Artemis III will land the first woman and the first person of color on the lunar surface. The crew will travel aboard the Orion spacecraft, which will launch atop the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket. Once in lunar orbit, astronauts will transfer to a Starship Human Landing System (HLS) developed by SpaceX. The mission will focus on the Moonâ€™s south polar region and include a week-long surface stay. The crew will conduct scientific research, test lunar exploration technologies, and gather data to support future Mars missions. NASA has emphasized international and commercial partnerships as key to Artemis. The mission builds on the successes of Artemis I (uncrewed) and Artemis II (crewed lunar flyby in 2025). Artemis III represents the first crewed lunar landing since Apollo 17 in 1972.", "target": "- Artemis III scheduled for Sept 2026\n- First woman and person of color to walk on Moon\n- Week-long surface mission using SpaceX HLS"}
